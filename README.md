# Homework

Few general notes:

My goal was to use some new framework that had not used before and create the needed outcome with a simplistic solution.

The API has been built with python fastapi framework. No external database has been used, so data do not persist between restarts. The product information has been hardcoded, while orders can be generated and manipulated after that.

Only one of the homework goals could not be met. This is goal 3. make the app able to listen and configure ports. This is for me a new topic, been researching the topic but unfortunately with this time frame could not solve how it can be implemented into this project. Would like to discuss and hear more how this is meant to be done in this type of APIs. 

Time used for the project was:

3 hours for researching and deciding on the tech which to use.
8Â½ hours to get the project done.
1 hours to write the documents and setup repo.

## Requirements

Fastapi
`````
pip install fastapi
`````

Uvicorn
`````
pip install uvicorn[standard]
`````
## API functionalty

If not familiar with the framework it comes with an interactive documentation. Within this project it can be used with localhost:8000/docs. All the endpoints can be tested within the docs.
